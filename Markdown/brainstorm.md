# Breaking Bad Game - Implementation Ideas

## Interactive Meth Cooking Minigame
A chemistry-based minigame where Walter and Jesse cook meth. Players balance temperature gauges, mix chemicals in correct sequences, and time reactions. The quality of the batch affects in-game currency and reputation. Implement with simple UI sliders, timers, and particle effects for visual feedback. Success or failure determines product purity percentage.

## Character Heat System
A dynamic "heat" meter tracking how much attention characters draw from law enforcement. Actions like cooking meth, dealing, or suspicious behavior increase heat, while lying low or performing legitimate activities decrease it. Heat levels affect NPC interactions, police spawn rates, and quest availability. Implement using a global variable with timed decay and visual indicator.

## Environmental Storytelling
Transform key Breaking Bad locations with interactive objects that reveal narrative without dialogue. The RV's equipment tells the cooking story, Walter's home shows family dynamics, and Gus's restaurant conceals lab hints. Implement using interactable objects with subtle visual cues (highlights on hover) that trigger brief camera focus or UI elements showing significance.
